# Driver Telematics Analysis Project

AXA has raised a competition in www.kaggle.com to identify trips which are not from 
the driver of interest. The dataset AXA provides over 50,000 anonymized driver trips, expressed 
as instant coordinate, that is, a pair of (x,y) coordinate per second, from which we can 
extract useful features, such as velocity and acceleration. Each driver is associated with 200 trips, including
both real trips as well as a small and random number of false trips (trips that were not
driven by the driver of interest). At a first glance, this is a unsupervised problem because trip labels are
not given. This is actually a anomaly detection problem because the final mission is
to identify the false or anomaly trips.

Here is my code to solve this driver fingerprint extraction problem.

**`plot/`** is blank directory used to save trip data visualization figures.

**`drivers/`** is a trip dataset for many drivers. Sub-directory names represent the driver number. There are thousands
of drivers but I only put the data for driver No. 1 for testing. Under `drivers/1/`, there are 200 cvs trip
files for driver number one. Data for other drivers can be downloaded from
[here] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/axa-driver-telematics-analysis/data).

**`data-prep.py`** is a Python script used to do data cleanning, feature extraction and trip data visualization. 
The feature data will be saved to a JSON file `dictfeature`.

**`data-predict.py`** is a Python script used to determine whether the 200 trip data under 
each driver directory is anomaly or not with many anomaly detection methods. It will read the `dictfeature`
output produced by `data-prep.py`.
